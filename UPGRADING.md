# Upgrading

What a change that breaks something asks of you, newest first: the plugin,
its version, what breaks, and what to do. Every other change needs nothing
but installing the new code (see each plugin's README). CI refuses a change
that breaks the API's contract without a line here.

## xymonapi-mcp, xymonapi-rag 0.1.0

The clients send a token and nothing else: `XYMONAPI_USER`,
`XYMONAPI_PASSWORD` and `XYMONAPI_PASSWORD_FILE` are no longer read. A
machine set up with a password gets 401: run the setup script from the API's
`/client` again, which gets it a token.

## xymonapi 0.1.0

A user removed from the password file loses every client token at the first
use of one; putting the user back does not bring them back. Each of that
user's machines runs the setup script again for a new token.
